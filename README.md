# iobroker-mower-rollershutter

This script can be imported in ioBroker to control a roller shutter (through a Shelly Wi-Fi relais) based on
states of an automatic mower from Gardena.

In order to use this script, the following adapters have to be installed and the datapoints variables inside the script need to be changed according to your own datapoints:

-   Gardena adapter
-   Smartgarden adapter
-   Shelly adapter
